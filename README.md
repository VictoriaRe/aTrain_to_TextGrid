# Converting aTrain files to TextGrid

### 1. Download the Jupyter Notebook  
Before you begin, you need to download the Jupyter Notebook file from GitHub. Go to the [aTrain_to_TextGrid GitHub repository](https://github.com/your-repository-link), locate the notebook file (e.g., `aTrain_to_TextGrid.ipynb`), and click on it. Then, click the **"Download"** button or the **"Raw"** button to save the file to your computer.

## Setting Up Python and Jupyter Notebook

### 2. Install Python  
To run the code, you need to have Python installed. You can check if Python is installed by running:  

```sh
python --version
```

or

```sh
python3 --version
```

If Python is not installed, download and install it from the official website:  
[Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)  

Make sure to check the box **"Add Python to PATH"** during installation.

## 3. Install Jupyter Notebook  
Once Python is installed, open a terminal (Command Prompt, Terminal, or PowerShell) and install Jupyter Notebook by running:  
```sh
pip install notebook
```
If you are using **Anaconda**, Jupyter is already included.

## 4. Open Jupyter Notebook  
After installation, start Jupyter Notebook by running:  
```sh
jupyter notebook
```
This will open Jupyter Notebook in your default web browser. Choose this file that you have downloaded from GitHub.

You are now ready to run the code!
